[**Unifying Motion Deblurring and Frame Interpolation with Events**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12178)

Slow shutter speed and long exposure time of frame-based cameras often cause visual blur and loss of inter-frame information, degenerating the overall quality of captured videos. To this end, we present a unified framework of event-based motion deblurring and frame interpolation for blurry video enhancement, where the extremely low latency of events is leveraged to alleviate motion blur and facilitate intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the mapping relation between blurry frames and sharp latent images is first predicted by a learnable double integral network, and a fusion network is then proposed to refine the coarse results via utilizing the information from consecutive blurry inputs and the concurrent events. By exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event streams, we further propose a self-supervised learning framework to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events.

## Environment setup
- Python 3.7
- Pytorch 1.4.0
- opencv-python 3.4.2
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA
- numpy, argparse

You can create a new [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) environment with the above dependencies as follows.
<br>
```
conda create -n evdi python=3.7
conda activate evdi
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download model and data
Pretrained models and some example data can be downloaded via [**Google Drive**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NkdkRWdKMQG-UKSOurhaounVSYwJ-HJ9?usp=sharing).
<br>
In our paper, we conduct experiments on three types of data:
- **GoPro** contains synthetic blurry images and synthetic events. We first convert [REDS](https://seungjunnah.github.io/Datasets/reds.html) into high frame rate videos using [RIFE](https://github.com/hzwer/arXiv2021-RIFE), and then obtain blurry images by averaging sharp frames and generate events by [ESIM](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_vid2e).
- **HQF** contains synthetic blurry images and real-world events from [HQF](https://timostoff.github.io/20ecnn), where blurry images are generated using the same manner as GoPro.
- **RBE** contains real-world blurry images and real-world events from [RBE](https://github.com/xufangchn/Motion-Deblurring-with-Real-Events).


## Quick start
### Initialization
- Change the parent directory to './codes/'
```
cd codes
```
- Copy the pretrained model to directory './PreTrained/'
- Copy the example data to directory './Database/'

### Test
- Test GoPro data
```
python Test.py --test_ts=0.5 --model_path=./PreTrained/EVDI-GoPro.pth --test_path=./Database/GoPro/ --save_path=./Result/EVDI-GoPro/ 
```
- Test HQF data
```
python Test.py --test_ts=0.5 --model_path=./PreTrained/EVDI-HQF.pth --test_path=./Database/HQF/ --save_path=./Result/EVDI-HQF/ 
```
- Test RBE data
```
python Test.py --test_ts=0.5 --model_path=./PreTrained/EVDI-RBE.pth --test_path=./Database/RBE/ --save_path=./Result/EVDI-RBE/
```
Change test_ts (in \[0,1\]) to generate results at arbitrary time instances.

### Train
If you want to train your own model, please modify the parameters in 'Train.py' according to your need and run
```
python Train.py
```
